<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><span
style='font-size:24.0pt;line-height:107%'>1. Terms and Conditions</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>1.1
These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) will govern the sale and license of all
goods and services offered by Trams LTD (“Trams”). By ordering or accepting
delivery of goods or services, the customer (“you”) accepts and agrees to these
Terms and the Terms of Trams’ privacy policy located on Trams’ website at
www.trams.co.uk/privacy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>1.2
These Terms contain the entire agreement between the parties superseding all
prior discussions, representations, promotional material, web-site content,
document, correspondence, or any other terms. You acknowledge that you have not
placed reliance upon any terms, representations, conditions or warranties, express
or implied by statute, common law or otherwise, other than expressly set out in
these Terms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>1.3
These Terms will apply in place of and prevail over any terms that may be
implied by trade practice or course of dealing, or any terms that may be
contained in any purchase order or other document of customer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>Trams’
staff are not authorized to alter the Terms under any circumstances. Any
variation to these Terms must be agreed to in writing and signed by a director
of Trams. For some products and services additional terms may apply, which
Trams will provide to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>1.4
Any quotation or estimate by Trams does not constitute an offer. A contract
will only come into existence upon the earlier of a written acceptance by Trams
of your order or upon delivery of goods to you. You are responsible for
ensuring the accuracy of any order. Once a contract is formed, it may not be
cancelled by you without Trams’ written consent. You agree to indemnify Trams
against all losses including loss of profits, costs, damages, charges and
expenses arising from your cancellation. In the event that Trams agrees to your
cancellation, Trams reserves the right to apply a cancellation charge of fifty
pounds (£50.00) or 25% of the price of the cancelled order, whichever is
greater. Refunds will not be given for items that have been opened or which
have not been returned within 7 days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>2.
Price and Payment</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>2.1
Prices are as per our published list price from time to time. Trams reserves
the right to change its prices prior to delivery due to changes in market
conditions, and at any time to correct errors or misprints. All prices exclude
delivery costs which will be charged at the rate prevailing at the time. All
prices and delivery costs exclude VAT.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>2.2
Unless otherwise specified by Trams in writing, payment is required in cleared
funds at the time of order. To open a credit account with Trams, you will need
to complete a signed credit account application form. The opening of a credit
account is subject to credit checks and satisfactory references being provided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>2.3
If Trams grant you credit you must adhere to Trams’ payment terms – which is
payment strictly within 30 days from the date of invoice. Trams reserves the
right at any time to stop supplying goods and services to you at Trams’
absolute discretion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>2.4
Payment is required in £ Sterling unless otherwise agreed. Time of payment is
of the essence. Payment must be made in full without any deduction or set off.
Overdue amounts may incur interest at a rate of 3% above Barclay Bank Plc’s
annual base rate from time to time (to accrue from day to day) after as well as
before any judgment and you shall indemnify Trams against the cost of
recovering any outstanding amounts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>3.
Delivery Risk, Title and Returns</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>3.1
Any delivery dates quoted are estimates only, and Trams will not be liable for
any delay in delivery howsoever caused. Time of delivery is not of the essence.
Delivery by instalments may be made and each such delivery will be treated as a
separate contract, unless otherwise agreed by Trams in writing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>3.2
Risk in goods will pass to you on delivery. Property in the goods will remain
with Trams until Trams has received in cleared funds full payment for the goods
and for all other goods and services sold to you. Until such time as property
in the goods passes to you, you undertake: (i) to keep the goods separate and
identifiable as Trams’ goods; (ii) to keep the goods properly protected and
insured for their full value; (iii) not to encumber, sell, lease or otherwise
part with possession of the goods, and if you do sell them to hold the proceeds
separately on Trams’ behalf; and (iv) to give Trams access to any premises
where the goods are stored to inspect or recover the goods at any time.</p>

order with you for fulfilment by Trams or a corresponding order is placed by
you with Trams, where such orders are found by Trams or you to be fraudulent.
Neither Trams nor its carriers and/or agents shall be liable to you should
Trams or the carriers have delivered Products in accordance with your
instructions received before the order is released for shipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>3.4
The Customer is responsible for the accuracy of all information provided about
its customers including but not limited to name and ship-to address. Trams
shall not be liable to you for any loss or damage arising from inaccurate or
erroneous information if Trams has relied upon such information or shipping
instructions as provided by you. We may from time to time request additional
written assurances should we suspect that any order placed by you might be the
subject of fraudulent or other criminal activity or attempt by any third party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>3.5
The Customer shall upon receipt of the Products sign the delivery note (proof
of delivery) and be responsible for complying with the applicable shipping
requirements of Trams, its carriers or agents. The Customer’s sign-off on Trams
delivery shall be at carton level. Trams shall be entitled to assume that any
person who both reasonably appears and claims to have authority to accept
delivery who signs a note in respect of the delivery on behalf of the Customer
or the Customer’s customer (if your order to Trams has requested we make
delivery to an address that is in the name of another party) does in fact have
the authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>3.6
If you have not received the goods you must inform Trams in writing and by
telephone within 5 working days of the date of invoice. Goods must be properly
inspected by you on delivery. Any shortages, non-conformity with description or
defects or damage reasonably apparent on a proper inspection must be notified
to Trams by telephone immediately and in any event, in writing within 5 working
days of receipt of the goods. Late claims will not be entertained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>3.7
In the event goods needs to be returned to Trams for any reason, you must first
obtain Trams’ prior authorisation, and if approved Trams will provide you with
a returns number which must be marked on the outside of the package. Goods
returned to Trams without proper authorisation or which have been damaged in
transit will not be accepted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'>4.
